	<h1>Sum of Square Errors (SSE)</h1>
	<p>		Sum of Square Errors is the sum of the squared differences between each observation and it's group mean.
		It can be used to measure variation with a cluster. If all the cases within a cluster are identical then <b>SSE</b> 
		would then be equal to <i>zero</i>(0)</p>
		
	<p>The formula of finding SSE is </p>
	
	<p> ___________________________________</p>
	<p>
			SSE = ∑(y<sub>i</sub> - ŷ)<sup>2</sup>
