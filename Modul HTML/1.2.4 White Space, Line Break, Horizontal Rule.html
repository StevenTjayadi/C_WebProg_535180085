</head>
<body>
	<p> 	Sum of Square Errors is the sum of the squared differences between observation and it's group mean. <br /> It can be used to measure variation and it's group mean
		If all the cases within a cluster are identical then <b>SSE</b> would then be equal to <i>zero</i>(0)</p>
		
	<p> This is the formula of finding SSE : </p>

	<p> SSE = ∑(y<sub>i</sub> - ŷ)<sup>2</sup>
